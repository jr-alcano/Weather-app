    Add to Favorites: Registered users can add cities to their list of favorite locations for quick access to weather details.
    Weather Forecast: The app provides current weather information and an 8-day forecast, including:
        Current temperature
        Weather description (e.g., Clear sky, Light rain)
        Minimum and maximum temperatures
    User Authentication: Users can register and log in to save their favorite cities.
    Favorites Dashboard: A dedicated section to view and manage favorite cities.

 API Notes

    The app uses the Open-Meteo API to fetch weather details and forecasts.
    The Nominatim Geocoding API is used to resolve city names into latitude and longitude for API requests.
    Both APIs are free to use.

 Why These Features?

The features were chosen to create a user experience for checking weather information and saving commonly searched cities. Adding favorites makes it easy for frequent users to keep track of their preferred locations.

Nominatim was not orginally part of the plan, I learned later that Open Meteo only took latitutde and longitude as arguments.
So Nominatim was used to convert a general location like Chicago, Illinois into coordinates which I could use for Open Meteo.
